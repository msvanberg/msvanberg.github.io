I am a PhD student in Technology Management and Economics at Chalmers University of Technology, working to understand how we can steer the development of critical technologies and systems. Specifically, I am looking at mission-oriented innovation policy in the context of industrial decarbonization. 

I enjoy thinking about economic equality, societal resilience, and sustainability, and working with quantitative empirical methods. I spent the early years of my career in the software industry developing AI and other data-intensive technologies. 

I hold degrees in *Technology and Policy* and *Computer Science* from MIT and Wellesley College. My master's thesis, building a model comparing the cost of human labor to the cost of AI, was awarded with the MIT Technology and Policy Thesis Prize and featured in many main-stream media outlets. 

For fun, I love to ski, rock climb, play soccer, and run.
