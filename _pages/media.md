My work in the media
======

The report resulting from my master's thesis on the implications of AI-development costs received international attention. It was cited by the White House Council of Economic Advisors in [The 2024 Economic Report of the President](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/03/21/the-2024-economic-report-of-the-president/) and Nobel Laureate Daron Acemoglu relied on it to produce his article ["The simple macroeconomics of AI"](https://academic.oup.com/economicpolicy/article/40/121/13/7728473).

Since I no longer do research on AI trends, I am not available for interviews on the topic.
