I work to understand how we can steer the development of critical technologies.

My interests broadly center on strategic emerging technologies as they relate to economic equality, labor, resilience, policy and business strategy, human capital, and education. Previously, I have worked on corporate data strategy, causal inference, privacy guarantees, large scale data integrations, business intelligence, and education technology.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from Wellesley College and a Master of Science in Technology and Policy from MIT. My master's thesis was awarded with the Technology and Policy Thesis Prize by MIT. 

I love to ski, boulder, play soccer, and run.
