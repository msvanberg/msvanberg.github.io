I work to understand how we can steer the development of critical technologies.

My interests broadly center on strategic emerging technologies as they relate to economic equality, labor, resilience, policy and business strategy, human capital, and education. Previously, I have worked on corporate data strategy, causal inference, privacy guarantees, large scale data integrations, business intelligence, and education technology.

I hold degrees in *Computer Science* and *Technology and Policy* from MIT and Wellesley College. My master's thesis was awarded with the MIT Technology and Policy Thesis Prize. 

I love to ski, boulder, play soccer, and run.
