I am a PhD student in Technology Management and Economics at Chalmers University of Technology, working to understand how we can steer technological development. Specifically, I am looking at Swedish innovation policy for decarbonization by 2045. 

I enjoy thinking about economic equality, societal resilience, and sustainability, and working with quantitative empirical methods. I spent the early years of my career in the software industry developing AI and other data-intensive technologies. 

I hold degrees in *Technology and Policy* and *Computer Science* from MIT and Wellesley College. My master's thesis was awarded with the MIT Technology and Policy Thesis Prize.

Outside of work, I enjoy writing and playing soccer.
